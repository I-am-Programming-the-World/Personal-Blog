# Personal-Blog
A *mobile-first* responsive **Personal Blog** developed using HTML, CSS &amp; JS, with ***Google fonts*** and ***Ionicons*** integration!
***
The code is well-organized and follows best practices for creating a stylish and elegant portfolio website. Let's go through each section and understand its purpose and functionality.
<ul type="square">
  <li>The HTML structure contains the necessary default <em>meta tags</em></li>
  <li>A <strong>Favicon</strong> has been added using the following link tag: 
    <pre><code>&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="./assets/images/favicon.ico"&gt;</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>A default <em>Google font</em> has been imported; This can be done, via the following steps:</li>
      <ol type="1">
          <li>Go to the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Fonts</a> website.</li>
          <li>Browse through the available fonts and select the <em>font-family</em> & <em>font-size</em> you want to use in your project!</li>
          <li>Once you have chosen your desired fonts, click on the <strong>"Select This Font"</strong> button for each font you need.</li>
          <li>After selecting all the fonts, a font selection drawer will appear at the bottom of the screen. In the drawer, click on the <strong>"Embed"</strong> tab.</li>
          <li>
            In the <strong>"Embed"</strong> tab, you will see the HTML code snippet to add the fonts to your project. Copy the code into your source code (Preferrably after the <em>meta tags</em> in the <em>head</em> section). <br> The code will look something like this:
              <pre><code>&lt;link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin&gt;
&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=FontName&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>Modify the <em>href</em> attribute value to include the desired font family name. Replace <strong>"FontName"</strong> in the snippet with the actual name of the <em>font family</em> you selected from Google Fonts.</li>
          <li>Save the HTML code and proceed to the incorporation of the remaining features.</li>
      </ol>
  <li>Finally, the required <em>stylesheet</em>, <em>script</em> & <em>ionicons</em> assets are linked to the HTML page!</li>
</ul>
